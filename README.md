# Classifying-Song-Genres-from-Audio-Data

A classifier was trained to distinguish between the two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock) using a dataset comprised of songs. The classification was based solely on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify). The data was first subsetted, information was aggregated, and plots were created when exploring the data for any obvious trends or factors that needed to be taken into consideration when performing machine learning.

Following that, an attempt was made to predict whether a song's genre could be correctly classified based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc. This was accomplished using the scikit-learn package.
